## GodotSteam Compatibility

In general, this project aims to be as close to the [original GodotSteam implementation](https://godotsteam.com/) as possible to ensure compatibility of documentation material and a smooth transition process. Existing GodotSteam GDScript tutorials should be applicable 1-1 with little to no changes.

Some methods in this project return a specific enum or constant rather than a generic `long` for ease of use and a better developer experience.
